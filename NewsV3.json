Weâ€™ve always strived to put our users first and give you an amazing experience. It breaks our hearts that we canâ€™t continue this journey with you.\n\nHowever, this isnâ€™t the end! Weâ€™re already thinking about new projects and apps to bring you even more fun and creativity in the future. Weâ€™ll be back with something new, and we hope youâ€™ll join us again when that time comes.\n\nThank you for being with us and believing in what we do. You are what made this journey worthwhile, and we canâ€™t wait to share new adventures with you soon."
